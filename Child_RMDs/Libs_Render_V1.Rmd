#### A software framework for ethical computational modelling

```{r softwarefw}
libs_tb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(c(rep(T,6),
                  rep(F,length(r_libs_chr)-6))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Name_title = paste0(Name,
                                        " - ",
                                        Title)) %>%
