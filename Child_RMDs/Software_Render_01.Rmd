## ready4 - A prototype software framework for transparent, reusable and updatable health economic models

The ready4 documentation website is https://ready4-dev.com.

The six R libraries that implement ready4 are detailed below and also at https://www.ready4-dev.com/docs/software/libraries/releases/. 

```{r softwarefw}
libs_tb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(c(rep(T,6),
                  rep(F,length(r_libs_chr)-6))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Name_title = paste0(Name,
                                        " - ",
                                        Title)) %>%
  vitae::detailed_entries(what = Author,
                          when = Date,
                          with = Name_title,
                          where = Version,
                          .protect = TRUE)
```
