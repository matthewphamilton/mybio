## readyforwhatsnext - an open source economic model of youth mental health

The readyforwhatsnext model is documented at https://readyforwhatsnext.org/.

Currently available R libraries that implement the readyforwhatsnext model are listed below and also at https://readyforwhatsnext.org/docs/tutorials/finding/libraries/.

```{r softwaremod}
libs_tb %>% 
  dplyr::filter(c(rep(F,6),
                  rep(T,length(r_libs_chr)-6))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Name_title = paste0(Name,
                                        " - ",
                                        Title)) %>%
  vitae::detailed_entries(what = Author,
                          when = Date,
                          with = Name_title,
                          where = Version,
                          .protect = TRUE)
```
